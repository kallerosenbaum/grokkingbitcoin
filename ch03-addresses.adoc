This chapter covers

* Basic privacy

* Replacing names with public key hashes

* Protecting against expensive typing errors

By the time you reach the end of this chapter, the cookie token
spreadsheet will no longer have personal names—you’ll be replacing
these names with hashes of public keys. This is useful from a privacy
perspective. No one can easily see who’s paying whom, making it harder
for others to extract information from the spreadsheet and see how
many cookies any of your coworkers eat. Lisa also finds this useful
because she doesn’t have to maintain a table of names and public keys.

When switching to public key hashes in the spreadsheet, coworkers will
no longer use names in their emails to Lisa. They will instead use
strings of hex code representing public key hashes. This means it will
be easy to make typing errors. If you make a typing error, your money
may end up digitally burned!

Some coworkers invent cookie token addresses (Bitcoin addresses) that
protect them from losing money due to typing errors
(<<fig0301>>). Cookie token addresses are used between users to pay
each other, pretty much like an email address, but they aren’t used in
the spreadsheet.

[[fig0301]]
.Cookie token addresses are exactly the same as Bitcoin addresses. They’re used mainly by wallet software.

=== Cookie-eating habits disclosed

.Acme Insurances
****
This highly unethical insurance company will make serious attempts to
spy on your habits, to “adjust” your premium.
****

You and many of your coworkers have health insurance with Acme
Insurances. Acme has persuaded John to give it a copy of the
spreadsheet. Acme figures it can adjust premiums or hold workers’
cookie-eating habits (<<fig0302>>) against them in an eventual
insurance dispute.

[[fig0302]]
.Acme Insurances keeps an eye on Chloe’s cookie-eating habits.
image::{imagedir}/03-02.svg[{half-width}]

Another disturbing fact about the spreadsheet is that every coworker
can easily look up other coworkers’ balances, as well as their
cookie-eating habits.

The coworkers have asked Lisa to come up with a solution to these
problems. Otherwise, they’ll stop using the spreadsheet.

=== Replacing names with public keys

****
image:{imagedir}/u03-01.svg[]
****

Lisa has kept the table of names and public keys updated at all times
since the coworkers started using digital signatures. She’s sick of
doing this, so she comes up with an idea that will benefit both her and
her coworkers: Lisa will replace all names in the spreadsheet with their
respective public keys (<<fig0303>>).

[[fig0303]]
.Replacing names with public keys. The spreadsheet is now more unreadable, which is good from a privacy perspective.
image::{imagedir}/03-03.svg[{big-width}]

It’s now hard to see how many cookies Chloe has eaten without knowing
her public key. If Acme Insurances receives this new spreadsheet, it
won’t be able to see who the senders and recipients +
are. It will see only the sender and recipient public keys of each
payment.

Lisa can now delete her cumbersome table of names and public keys. But
when she does this, users should no longer use names when making
payments. They must instead use the sender’s public key and the
recipient’s public key (<<fig0304>>).


.Old style
****
image::{imagedir}/u03-02.svg[]
****

[[fig0304]]
.New-style payment using public keys instead of names
image::{imagedir}/03-04.svg[{half-width}]

The email to Lisa contains a few vital parts:

* A message containing the

** Amount

** Sender public key

** Recipient public key

* A signature made with the sender’s private key

The essential difference is that the payment is now pseudonymous:
names are replaced with the corresponding public keys. Otherwise, the
payment looks the same as before.

==== New payment process

Suppose a new coworker just started at the company. Her name is Faiza.
The company wants to send her 100 CT as a welcome gift. How can the
company send 100 CT to Faiza?

First, the company needs the recipient’s—Faiza’s—public key. Faiza
hasn’t used cookie tokens yet, so she needs to create a key pair and
give the public key to the sender—the company—as <<fig0305>> shows.

[[fig0305]]
.Faiza creates her public key and gives it to the company. The company creates a payment with Faiza’s public key as the recipient.
image::{imagedir}/03-05.svg[{full-width}]

Faiza creates a private and a public key, following the same process
described in <<improving-cookie-token-security>>, but she doesn’t give
her public key to Lisa. Now that Lisa doesn’t have the table of names
and public keys, there’s no longer any point in giving her the
public key. She doesn’t need it. Instead, Faiza gives the public key
to the entity that wants to pay her cookie tokens—the company.

The company creates a message asking Lisa to move 100 CT from
`037e944a…36de9496` to `029a726c…ad8f436d`. It then digitally signs
the message and sends it to Lisa. Lisa uses

* The message

* The sender’s public key

* The signature

[.inbitcoin]
.Lisa In Bitcoin
****
Lisa is performing the same duties with cookie token payments that a
Bitcoin miner would do with Bitcoin payments.
****

to verify that the message is signed with the private key belonging to
the sender’s public key. She also verifies that the sender’s public key
has enough funds in the spreadsheet. She does this the same way she did
when the spreadsheet contained names—she searches for the sender’s
public key and calculates the balance.

Lisa has never seen the recipient’s public key before, but she doesn’t
care. She cares only that the sender has the money to spend and that the
message is correctly signed. She’ll write into the spreadsheet’s
recipient column whatever the message asks her to write.


****
image::{imagedir}/u03-03.svg[]
****

Faiza sees the new row with her public key in the To column. It gives
her a warm, fuzzy feeling. She can now spend her cookie tokens as she
pleases. Faiza didn’t have to bother Lisa with her public key, saving
Lisa a lot of work.

Let’s summarize what’s happened so far:

* Names have been replaced with public keys in the spreadsheet.

* Lisa has thrown away the table of names and public keys.

* Payments are made using public keys instead of names to denote sender
and recipient.

These changes have improved privacy and simplified Lisa’s work. At the
end of this chapter, we’ll discuss more about how to further improve
privacy.

The email to Lisa in this example probably reveals, _to Lisa_, who the
sender is (the company, in this case) because of the From field of the
email. For now, we can assume Lisa doesn’t reveal or use this personal
information in any way. We use email in this example in place of
Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network. The Bitcoin network, discussed in detail
in <<ch08>>, doesn’t use any personal information.

Please take a moment to think about what Acme Insurances can now figure
out from the spreadsheet. What information can it get if it figures out
the name of the sender or recipient of _one_ payment? It will be able to
identify all payments that person has made.

=== Shortening the public key

Using public keys in the spreadsheet improved privacy, but such keys
take up a lot of space compared to names. The name “John” takes 4 bytes
in the spreadsheet, whereas a public key takes 33 bytes. Keeping the
spreadsheet as small as possible is important because a smaller
spreadsheet means faster downloading for coworkers wanting to check
their balance; it also takes less space on Lisa’s hard drive.

==== Hashing the public key to 20 bytes


****
image::{imagedir}/u03-04.svg[]
****

Among the coworkers, some developers think they can replace 33-byte
public keys with something shorter while still preserving enough
security. They suggest replacing each public key in the cookie token
spreadsheet with a cryptographic hash of the public key. This shortens
senders and recipients in the spreadsheet but also protects users’
money in the event of a flaw in the public key derivation function, as
we’ll see later. The hashing isn’t made with a single cryptographic
hash function but with two different cryptographic hash functions, as
<<fig0306>> illustrates. We’ll discuss the reason for using two hash
functions in the next section.

[[fig0306]]
.Replacing the public keys with the RIPEMD160 hash of the SHA256 hash of the public key
image::{imagedir}/03-06.svg[{full-width}]

The public key is first hashed with SHA256, which you should be
familiar with from the previous chapter. The output of this
cryptographic hash function is then hashed with RIPEMD160, a
cryptographic hash function that outputs a 160-bit (20-byte)
number. We call this final hash the _public key hash_ (PKH). All
public keys in the spreadsheet are replaced with their respective
PKHs.

.Old style payment
****
image::{imagedir}/u03-05.svg[]
****

The payment process now differs from when Faiza received her 100 CT from
the company. Suppose John wants to buy a cookie (<<fig0307>>).

[[fig0307]]
.John buys a cookie. The sender is still a public key, but the recipient is a PKH instead of public key. Lisa needs to create the PKH from the sender’s public key to verify the balance and execute the payment.
image::{imagedir}/03-07.svg[{big-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.p2pkh
****
Most payments in Bitcoin are made with a PKH as the recipient. This
type is often called _pay-to-public-key-hash_ (p2pkh), but other
payment types exist as well.
****

First, the message to Lisa is changed a bit. John must use the cafe’s
PKH—which was previously a public key—as the recipient. The sender is
still a public key in the message because that public key is needed to
verify the signature. Lisa doesn’t keep people’s public keys around
anymore.

Second, because the spreadsheet now contains PKHs, Lisa must calculate
the PKH from the sender’s public key to check the sender’s balance and
be able to enter the payment into the spreadsheet.

==== Why SHA256 and RIPEMD160?

Using RIPEMD160 as the last cryptographic hash function is a deliberate
choice to make the PKHs shorter. Compare the output from SHA256 with the
output from RIPEMD160:

 SHA256:
 85ae273f0aa730eddf2285d3f3ab071eb29caba1e428db90e6dfbd71b8e1e918
 RIPEMD160:
 5f2613791b36f667fdb8e95608b55e3df4c5f9eb

It’s a well-balanced trade-off between security and size.

But why have two different cryptographic hash functions? We don’t
really know why this scheme was chosen for Bitcoin because its
inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, has stopped corresponding with the Bitcoin
community.  We can only speculate. Instead, let’s discuss some of the
scheme’s properties.

If either hash function isn’t pre-image-resistant, the other still is.
This means if you can calculate an input to RIPEMD160 that gives a
certain PKH output, you still need to pre-image attack SHA256 (with
about 2^255^ guesses) to find the public key. Likewise, if you can
calculate an input to SHA256 that gives a certain output, you first
need to pre-image attack RIPEMD160 before you can use that pre-image
to calculate the public key.

****
image::{imagedir}/u03-06.svg[]
****

On the other hand, if it turns out that the output set of either
cryptographic hash function is smaller than anticipated, then the
security of the combined hash-function chain suffers. To make this
clearer, pretend SHA256 has only 100 possible output values. You can
steal money from anyone by trying different random private keys and
calculating the corresponding PKHs. If a PKH matches your target,
you’ve found a private key you can steal the money with. On average,
you’d only have to test 50 different private keys to steal from
one PKH. This property gives the worst of both worlds: if either of
the two functions is weak, then the whole chain is weak. The
probability that any function has this flaw is small. If any such flaw
exists, the reduction in the output set likely isn’t significant
enough to endanger security in practice. Remember, we’ve yet to find
one single collision in any of these cryptographic hash functions.

Another thing to note is that different organizations developed the
two cryptographic hash functions. RIPEMD160 was developed at a
European university in open collaboration with a broad community of
cryptographers. SHA256 was developed by the US National Security
Agency (NSA). Both are considered secure, and both have been subject
to scrutiny from a large number of people.

[.gbinfo]
.Has privacy improved?
****
No.
****

Now that we’ve strengthened the security of the cookie token
spreadsheet, let’s think about privacy again. Has this improved privacy?
Is it harder for Acme Insurances to figure out information about who’s
paying whom now compared to when we used public keys in the spreadsheet?

The answer is no. There is practically a one-to-one correspondence
between the public keys and the PKHs. Using PKHs doesn’t hide personal
information any more than using plain public keys.

=== Avoiding expensive typing errors

When Lisa verifies a payment before executing it, she doesn’t care who
the recipient is or if it’s even an existing recipient. She’ll put into
the recipient column of the spreadsheet whatever the payer asks her to.
She can’t even know if a recipient is valid or not, because she no
longer knows everyone’s public keys.

This is convenient for Lisa, but it can cause people to lose money if
they aren’t careful. Imagine once again that John wants to buy a cookie.
This time, he’s not careful enough when writing the message, as <<fig0308>> shows.

[[fig0308]]
.John makes a typo in the recipient in the email to Lisa. What now?
image::{imagedir}/03-08.svg[{big-width}]

He makes a typing error in the recipient PKH. The last character is `d`
when it should have been `c`. What happens now?

[.gbinfo]
.Any recipient goes
****
There is no “wrong” recipient PKH. Lisa adds any recipient as long as
the signature is valid.
****

John doesn’t notice the error and happily signs the message and sends
the email to Lisa. Lisa verifies the signature, which verifies fine,
and calculates the sender’s PKH. She doesn’t care about the
recipient. She inserts a new row in the spreadsheet paying from
`5f261379…f4c5f9eb` to `87e3d169…8393b1cd`.

Then she considers herself done, moving on to other interesting tasks.
The cafe owner, who is searching for his PKH in the spreadsheet,
doesn’t see an incoming payment. John stands at the counter in the
cafe yelling at the cafe owner that he _did_ send money, so “Give me
the freakin’ cookie!” The cafe owner refuses. John takes a close look
at the spreadsheet and searches for his PKH. He finds the one he just
made and realizes his spelling mistake.

****
image:{imagedir}/u03-07.svg[]
****

[role="important"]

John has sent money to a “public key hash” for which there is no known
private key. No one will ever be able to spend those 10 CT—not the
cafe, not John, nobody. John has just digitally burned 10 CT.

Unfortunately, this will probably happen again and again in the future
if nothing is done to prevent it. The problem can happen at any point
from when the cafe owner reads his own PKH to give to John to when
John writes his message before signing it. You could argue that Lisa
could also make this mistake when she updates the spreadsheet, but
she’s so thorough that this would _never_ happen. She’s just too good
at what she’s doing. Lisa will never cause someone else’s funds to be
burned.

[.periscope]
==== Where were we?

This chapter deals with Bitcoin addresses. To remind you where this
all fits into Bitcoin, remember the diagram from <<ch01>>, shown again
in <<fig0309>>.

[[fig0309]]
.Bitcoin addresses
image::{imagedir}/03-09.svg[{half-width}]

Toward the end of this chapter, we’ll end up with Bitcoin (cookie
token) addresses. We’ve just replaced the names in the spreadsheet
with PKHs.  We’ll now get to _Bitcoin addresses_. A Bitcoin address
is a _converted PKH_—that is, it’s a PKH written in a way more
suitable for human users and safe against spelling errors. The PKH is
sent to Lisa (or Bitcoin nodes), but the address is what users see and
give to each other.

==== Base58check

Among the coworkers, the security-oriented people discuss the problem
with typos and come up with the idea of _cookie token addresses_. A
cookie token address is a PKH _encoded_ to detect typing errors. The
PKH can be converted back and forth between this encoding and plain
byte format.

[.inbitcoin]
.Bitcoin addresses
****
Cookie token addresses are exactly the same as the most common version
of Bitcoin addresses. Other types of Bitcoin addresses are available,
however.
****

Suppose Faiza feels sorry for John and wants to give him 20 CT from
her 100 CT to ease his pain. She doesn’t want to make the same mistake
John did, so she asks him for his cookie token address. John creates
this by encoding his PKH with a function called _base58check_
(<<fig0310>>).

[[fig0310]]
.Overview of base58check encoding, which transforms a PKH into a cookie token address
image::{imagedir}/03-10.svg[{half-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Who uses cookie token addresses?
****
Cookie token addresses are employed only between users to safely
transmit a PKH. Lisa never sees them.
****

The result is John’s cookie token address: `19g6oo8f…gCenRBPD`. John
hands this address to Faiza, who then makes a payment following the
process in <<fig0311>>.

The payment process changes for the payer, but nothing changes for Lisa.
Faiza will base58check _decode_ John’s address into a PKH. This decoding
ensures that no typing errors were made in the address.

[[fig0311]]
.Faiza makes a payment to John’s cookie token address. She decodes the address into a PKH, verifying that the address isn’t misspelled.
image::{imagedir}/03-11.svg[{half-width}]

As mentioned previously, a PKH can be converted to an address and back
to a PKH. It is _not_ a one-way function. It’s just different ways to
_represent_ the PKH, either as a series of bytes or as an address
(<<fig0312>>).

[[fig0312]]
.The PKH can be encoded into an address and decoded back into the PKH.
image::{imagedir}/03-12.svg[{half-width}]

The email to Lisa is exactly the same as before. Only users employ the
cookie token address. It isn’t part of Lisa’s validation process or
the spreadsheet in any way.

===== Base58check encoding

Let’s see how this mysterious base58check encoding works
(<<fig0313>>).  First, a version is added before the PKH. The people
who came up with the idea of cookie token addresses wanted to make
future upgrades to the address format easy. Right now, only one
version of cookie token addresses is available. This version is a
single 0 byte.

[[fig0313]]
.Base58check encoding John’s PKH. A version is added to the hash, and then a checksum is created and appended to the versioned hash. Finally, the checksummed, versioned hash is base58 encoded.
image::{imagedir}/03-13.svg[{full-width}]


****
image::{imagedir}/u03-09.svg[]
****

To detect typing errors, a _checksum_ is added. This checksum is
calculated from the versioned PKH. To create a checksum, base58check
hashes the versioned PKH with double SHA256. This means it’s first
hashed with SHA256, and the resulting hash is hashed again with
SHA256.  Take the first 4 bytes of the second hash, and let those 4
bytes be the checksum. This checksum is then appended to the
versioned PKH. You’ll soon see how this checksum protects users from
typing errors. Be patient!

You started with a PKH of 20 bytes (40 hex characters). But now that
you’ve added a version and a checksum, you have 25 bytes (50 hex
characters). To make up for this increase, you’ll encode the 25 bytes
in a more compact way than hexadecimal encoding.

===== Using a more compact encoding

Hex encoding is an inefficient way to represent data bytes. It
requires 2 characters for each byte. We use only 16 characters, where
each character represent 4 bits, `0000` to `1111`.

Many encoding schemes exist that use more characters to represent data.
The most widely known is base64, in which each character represents 6
bits of data; to do this, the scheme needs more characters than just
letters and digits. Base64 uses the following alphabet:

 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/

The character `A` represents the bits `000000`, `B` represents
`000001`, and the character `/` represents `111111`. This is a nice,
easy, compact way to represent data with human-readable
characters. I’ve already used base64-encoded data several times in
this book to represent signatures.

****
image::{imagedir}/u03-10.svg[]
****

But base64 doesn’t quite fit the bill for cookie token addresses. We
need an encoding that doesn’t just detect typing errors when they happen
but minimizes the risk of making them. Notice how some characters look
similar in some fonts, like `lI` (lowercase L, capital I) and `0O` (zero
and capital O). We also need a format that users can easily copy and
paste, meaning special characters such as `+` and `/` shouldn’t be
allowed—they’ll prevent us from marking the whole address by
double-clicking it. Removing those six characters reduces the
possibility of typing errors. But now we have only 58 characters left,
so we need another type of encoding.

This new way to encode data is called _base58_ because the alphabet is
the following 58 character

 123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz

WARNING: If you feel put off by this low-level base58 mumbo jumbo, you can skip
to <<base58check-decoding>> and just accept that base58 is a way to encode
and decode data. For the rest of you, please continue. It’s fun.

In base64, each character represents exactly 6 bits, which makes it
straightforward to encode and decode data. But with base58, each
character represents slightly less than 6 bits but more than 5
bits. We need to encode data differently.

Let’s get back to the example in which John creates his address. He’s
just added a version and a checksum. Now it’s time to encode the 25
bytes into the final result: the address (<<base58-encoding>>).

[[base58-encoding]]
.Encoding John’s versioned and checksummed PKH with base58. The essential part is where you divide the number by 58 and keep the remainders, which are then mapped one by one in the lookup table.
image::{imagedir}/03-14.svg[{big-width}]

The overall strategy of base58 is to treat the data as a huge number
that you divide by 58 over and over until the quotient is 0; you keep
the remainders of every division. You look up each remainder in the
lookup table and append a `1` last for each leading 0 byte in the
input.  The string is finally reversed, and the result is John’s
cookie token address. Note that all cookie token addresses, not just
John’s, will start with a `1`. This is because the version byte is 0,
which is encoded by the character `1`.

You can decode base58-encoded data such as John’s address back to the
original input of the base58 encoding. I’ll leave this as an exercise
for the interested reader.

Note that base58 encoding is nothing new. It’s a generic way to
convert a decimal number to any other base. You can use the same
algorithm to convert to base3, instead—divide by 3 instead
of 58. Maybe you’d also like to change the lookup table to map 0 to 0,
1 to 1, and 2 to 2 to get the characters you’re used to. For example,
write 17 in base 3:

[stem]
++++
17=5*3+2 \\
5=1*3+2 \\
1=0*3+1
++++

Then, look up the remainders in the lookup table (same digits as the
ones you convert), and you’ll get `2 2 1`. Reverse that to get the final
result: `1 2 2`. Verify that it’s correct as follows:

[stem]
++++
1*3^2+2*3^1+2*3^0=9+6+2=17
++++



[id=base58check-decoding]
===== Base58check decoding

****
image::{imagedir}/u03-11.svg[]
****

John has just created his cookie token address by base58check encoding
his PKH. He’s given the address to Faiza so she can send him 20 CT. Now,
Faiza needs to write a message to Lisa. To do this, she needs John’s
PKH. The great thing about base58check encoding is that the process can
be reversed so you can get the PKH from the address while simultaneously
checking for typing errors (<<fig0315>>).

[[fig0315]]
.Base58check decoding is basically done by reversing the base58check encoding. Typing errors are detected when the checksums don’t match.
image::{imagedir}/03-15.svg[{full-width}]

Faiza takes John’s cookie token address and base58 decodes it. Then,
she removes the checksum and uses the remaining part, the versioned
PKH, to calculate the checksum again. The newly calculated checksum
and the just-removed checksum must match. Otherwise, a typing error
has occurred, in which case Faiza won’t create the message. She’ll
know the address was corrupted somewhere along the way and refrain
from sending an email to Lisa. She’ll verify that she entered the
address correctly and that John gave her the correct address to learn
where it went wrong.

How safe is the checksum? Suppose a typing error occurred in an
address.  What’s the probability that the checksum won’t detect the
error? The checksum is 4 bytes, which corresponds to 2^32^ ≈ 4.3
billion values.  The chance is about 1 in 4.3 billion that base58check
fails to detect the typing error. It’s pretty safe.

=== Back to privacy

Although privacy improved when we replaced names with PKHs, the
spreadsheet still reveals some information that Acme Insurances finds
useful.

[.inbitcoin]
.Forensics
****
This technique is often used in Bitcoin—for example, during crime
investigations.
****

For example, Acme can probably figure out the cafe has the PKH
`87e3d169…8393b1cc` because a lot of 10 CT payments have been made
to this PKH. From this, Acme will be able to see which PKHs are making
the most 10 CT payments to that PKH. Let’s say Acme talks to Faiza and
asks her for information about her recent payments. She’s made only one
payment so far, the one to John. Faiza, unaware of why Acme is asking
these questions, discloses that the transaction is for John.


.Dear John,
****
It has come to our attention that you live an unhealthy life. We have
therefore promoted you to a higher risk category. Congratulations.

Sincerely,
Acme Insurances
****

A week later, John receives a letter from Acme politely informing him
that he’s been promoted to a higher risk category, and his insurance
premium has been adjusted accordingly.

[role="important"]

Some privacy issues obviously remain. Luckily, users can create as
many addresses they like. For example, the cafe could create a unique
address for every incoming payment. And John could create a brand-new
cookie token address the next time he accepts cookie tokens from
Faiza.

Using unique addresses for each payment will make it harder for Acme
to extract information from the cookie token spreadsheet, because they
won’t be able to tell which payments belong to the same person.

=== Recap

This chapter started with replacing the names in the spreadsheet with
users’ respective PKHs.

image::{imagedir}/u03-12.svg[{big-width}]

Then, we used base58check to create an address from a PKH. Let’s put the
pieces together and look at the whole cookie token address-creation
process from random number generator to the address.

=== Exercises

==== Warm up

. The PKH is shorter than the public key—only 160 bits. We made it
shorter using RIPEMD160. Why do you want it to be shorter? There are
two good reasons.

. Base58check encoding is used to create a cookie token (Bitcoin)
address from a PKH. Is it possible to reverse this process to create a
PKH from an address?

. When is base58check decoding used, and by whom?

. Base58 encode the two hex bytes `0047`. Use the following diagram.
You may skip this exercise if you didn’t read the section on base58
encoding.

. Imagine that John wants a cookie from the cafe. He has two
addresses: @~1~ with a balance of 5 CT, and @~2~ with 8 CT. His total
balance is 13 CT, so he should be able to afford 10 CT for a cookie.
Give an example of how he could pay 10 CT to the cafe.

. Is it possible to deduce what cookie token addresses were involved
in a certain payment by looking at the following spreadsheet?

. Is it possible to deduce what public keys were involved in a certain
payment by looking at just the spreadsheet?

. Suppose everybody always used unique addresses for each
payment. What information from the spreadsheet could Acme use to
roughly identify the cafe’s addresses?

. Suppose there was a serious flaw in the public key derivation
function, so anyone could calculate the private key from a public key.
What prevents a bad guy from stealing your money in this scenario?

. Suppose there was a serious flaw in RIPEMD160, so anyone could
easily figure out a 256-bit pre-image of the PKH. This would mean it
wasn’t pre-image resistant. What prevents a bad guy from stealing your
money in this scenario?

=== Summary

* Privacy is important for you, not just for criminals.

* Using PKHs instead of personal names as recipients for payments is
important for privacy and more secure.

* Encoding a PKH as a Bitcoin address, or cookie token address,
reduces the risk of sending money into the void, thanks to the
checksum in the address.

* Only users care about Bitcoin addresses. The Bitcoin network, or
Lisa, deals with plain PKHs.

* You can have as many Bitcoin addresses as you like. Using multiple
addresses, preferably one per received payment, improves your privacy.
