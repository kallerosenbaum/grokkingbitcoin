== Cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures
:imagedir: {baseimagedir}/ch02

This chapter covers

* Creating a simple money system: cookie tokens

* Understanding cryptographic hash functions

* Authenticating payments using digital signatures

* Keeping your secrets secret

I’ll start this chapter by setting the stage for the rest of this
book.  We’ll look at a simple payment system that we can improve on
using Bitcoin technologies. By the time we get to <<ch08>>, this
simple system will have evolved into what we call Bitcoin.

The second part of this chapter will teach you what you need to know
about cryptographic hash functions. These are so important to Bitcoin
that you really need to understand them before learning anything else.
You’ll see how a cryptographic hash function can be used to verify
that a file hasn’t changed since a previous point in time.

The rest of the chapter will solve the problem of the _imposter_: a
bad guy claiming to be someone else to pay money from that someone’s
account. We solve this problem by introducing digital signatures
(<<fig0201>>) into the simple system.

=== The cookie token spreadsheet

Suppose there’s a cafe in the office where you work. You and your
coworkers use a spreadsheet to keep track of _cookie tokens_
(<<fig0202>>), which use the symbol CT. You can exchange cookie tokens
for cookies in the cafe.

[.inbitcoin]
.Bitcoin, the currency
****
[.movingtarget]

A cookie token corresponds to a bitcoin, the currency unit of
Bitcoin. Bitcoin got its first price point 2010 when someone bought
two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. That money would get you 6,000,000 pizzas
as of November 2018.
****

[[fig0202]]
.The cookie token spreadsheet has a column for the sender, a column for the recipient, and a column for the number of cookie tokens transferred. New cookie token transfers are appended at the end of the spreadsheet.
image::{imagedir}/02-02.svg[{half-width}]

Lisa stores this spreadsheet on her computer. It’s shared read-only
for everybody on the office network to open and watch, except
Lisa. Lisa is very trustworthy. Everybody trusts her. She has full
access to do whatever she likes with the spreadsheet. You and all the
others can only view the spreadsheet by opening it in read-only mode.

Whenever Alice wants a cookie, she asks Lisa, who sits right next to
the cafe, to transfer 10 CT from Alice to the cafe. Lisa knows who
Alice is and can verify in the spreadsheet that she owns enough cookie
tokens; she’ll search for “Alice” in the spreadsheet, sum all the
amounts with Alice’s name in the To column, and subtract all the
amounts with Alice’s name in the From column. <<fig0203>> shows the
complete search result; three transfers involve Alice.

[[fig0203]]
.Lisa calculates Alice’s balance. The sum of her received cookie tokens is 100, and the sum of her withdrawn cookie tokens is 30. Alice’s balance is 70 CT.
image::{imagedir}/02-03.svg[{big-width}]

Lisa calculates that Alice has 70 CT, enough for Alice to pay 10 CT to
the cafe. She _appends_ a row at the end of the spreadsheet (<<fig0204>>).

[[fig0204]]
.Lisa adds Alice’s payment for a cookie. The payment is appended last in the cookie token spreadsheet.
image::{imagedir}/02-04.svg[{half-width}]

The cafe sees this new row in the spreadsheet and hands a cookie over to
Alice.

[.gbinfo]
.Earn them
****
You can also get cookie tokens as part of your salary.
****

When you run out of cookie tokens, you can buy tokens for dollars from
someone who is willing to sell you some—possibly Anne or the cafe—at a
price you both agree on. Lisa will then add a row to the spreadsheet
accordingly.

[role="important"]

Lisa has promised never to remove or change anything in the
spreadsheet, just add to it. What happens in the spreadsheet, stays in
the spreadsheet!

Lisa, who is performing valuable work to secure this money system, is
rewarded with 7,200 newly minted cookie tokens per day (<<fig0205>>).
Every day, she adds a new row to the spreadsheet that creates 7,200
new cookie tokens with Lisa as the recipient.

[[fig0205]]
.Lisa is rewarded with cookie tokens.
image::{imagedir}/02-05.svg[{half-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Money supply curve
****
Bitcoin uses the same schedule for issuance as the cookie token
spreadsheet. All new bitcoins are created as rewards to the nodes
securing the Bitcoin ledger—the blockchain—just as Lisa is rewarded
for securing the cookie token spreadsheet.

image::{imagedir}/u02-01.svg[]
****

This is how all the cookie tokens in the spreadsheet are created. The
first row in the spreadsheet is a reward row—like the one in the
spreadsheet just shown—that creates the very first 7,200 CT ever. The
plan is that Lisa is rewarded with 7,200 CT per day during the first
four years, and then the reward is halved to 3,600 CT/day for the next
four years, and so on until the reward is 0 CT/day.

Don’t worry, for now, about what happens when the reward approaches
0—that’s far in the future. We’ll discuss that in <<ch07>>. This reward
halving makes the total money supply—the total number of cookie tokens
in circulation—approach 21 million CT, but it will never exceed 21
million.

What Lisa does with the new cookie tokens she earns is up to her. She
can buy cookies or sell the cookie tokens. She can also save them for
later. The spreadsheet system works well, and everybody eats a healthy
number of cookies.

Lisa basically performs the same work as miners in the Bitcoin network.
She verifies payments and updates the ledger, the cookie token
spreadsheet. <<tab0201>> clarifies how the concepts in the spreadsheet
correspond to concepts in Bitcoin.

[[tab0201]]

| The spreadsheet | The blockchain | <<ch06>>

|===

This table will follow us throughout the book. It describes differences
between the cookie token system and Bitcoin. I’ll delete rows from it as
I introduce various Bitcoin stuff. For example, the row “The
spreadsheet” will be deleted in <<ch06>>, when we use a blockchain to
store transactions. I’ll also add a few rows as I introduce new concepts
for the cookie token system that differ from those in Bitcoin.

At the end of <<ch08>>, this table will contain only the first row,
mapping 1 cookie token to 1 bitcoin. This will mark the end of this
cookie token example, and from that point, we’ll talk only about Bitcoin
itself.

<<tab0202>> is your starting point for learning how Bitcoin works, which
we can call version 1.0 of the cookie token spreadsheet system.

We’ll add a lot of fancy stuff to this system and release a new version
in every chapter. For example, at the end of this chapter, we’ll release
version 2.0, which uses digital signatures to solve the problem of
imposters. Every chapter will take us closer to the end result: Bitcoin.
But please be aware that this isn’t at all how Bitcoin evolved in
reality—I’m just using this made-up system to help explain each
important topic in isolation.

[id=cryptographic_hashing]
=== Cryptographic hashes

Cryptographic hashes are used everywhere in Bitcoin. Trying to learn
Bitcoin without knowing what cryptographic hashes are is like trying to
learn chemistry without knowing what an atom is.

You can think of a cryptographic hash as a fingerprint. A person will
produce the same fingerprint of her left thumb every time it’s taken,
but it’s extremely hard to find another person with the same left thumb
fingerprint. The fingerprint doesn’t disclose any information about the
person other than that particular fingerprint. You can’t know what math
skills or eye color the person has by looking at this fingerprint.

Digital information also has fingerprints. This fingerprint is called a
_cryptographic hash_. To create a cryptographic hash of a file, you
send the file into a computer program called a _cryptographic hash
function_. Suppose you want to create a cryptographic hash—a
fingerprint—of your favorite cat picture. <<fig0206>> illustrates this
process.

[[fig0206]]
.Creating a cryptographic hash of a cat picture. Input is the cat picture and output is a big number of 32 bytes.
image::{imagedir}/02-06.svg[{big-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Bits? Bytes? Hex?
****
A _bit_ is the smallest unit of information in a computer. It can take
either of two different values: 0 or 1. Like a lightbulb, it can be
either on or off. A _byte_ is 8 bits that together can take 256
different values. We often use _hexadecimal_, or _hex_, encoding
when we display numbers in this book. Each byte is printed as two hex
digits each in the range 0–f, where a = 10 and f = 15.

image::{imagedir}/u02-02.svg[]
****

The output—the hash—is a 256-bit number; 256 bits equals 32 bytes
because 1 byte consists of 8 bits. Thus, to store the number in a file,
the file will be 32 bytes big, which is tiny compared to the size of the
1.21 MB cat picture. The particular cryptographic hash function used in
this example is called SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm with 256-bit
output) and is the most commonly used one in Bitcoin.

The word _hash_ means something that’s chopped into small pieces or
mixed up. That’s a good description of what a cryptographic hash
function does. It takes the cat picture and performs a mathematical
calculation on it. Out comes a big number—the cryptographic hash—that
doesn’t look remotely like a cat. You can’t “reconstruct” the cat
picture from just the hash—a cryptographic hash function is a _one-way
function_. <<fig0207>> shows what happens when you change the cat
picture a little and run it through the same cryptographic hash
function.

[[fig0207]]
.Hashing a modified cat picture. Can you spot the difference? The cryptographic hash function certainly did.
image::{imagedir}/02-07.svg[{big-width}]

This hash turns out completely different than the first hash. Let's
compare them:

 Old hash: dee6a5d375827436ee4b47a930160457901dce84ff0fac58bf79ab0edb479561
 New hash: d2ca4f53c825730186db9ea585075f96cd6df1bfd4fb7c687a23b912b2b39bf6

See how that tiny change to the cat picture made a huge difference in
the hash value? The hash value is completely different, but the length
of the hash is always the same regardless of input. The input “Hello”
will also result in a 256-bit hash value.

==== Why are cryptographic hash functions useful?

Cryptographic hash functions can be used as an integrity check to detect
changes in data. Suppose you want to store your favorite cat picture on
your laptop’s hard drive, but you suspect the stored picture might
become corrupted. This could happen, for example, due to disk errors or
hackers. How can you make sure you detect corruption?

First, you calculate a cryptographic hash of the cat picture on your
hard drive and write it down on a piece of paper (<<fig0208>>).

[[fig0208]]
.Save a hash of the cat picture on a piece of paper
image::{imagedir}/02-08.svg[{big-width}]

Later, when you want to look at the picture, you can check if it’s
changed since you wrote the hash on that paper. Calculate the
cryptographic hash of the cat picture again, and compare it to the
original hash on your paper (<<fig0209>>).

[[fig0209]]
.Check the integrity of the cat picture. You detect a change.
image::{imagedir}/02-09.svg[{full-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.How sure?
****
There’s a tiny chance the cat picture has changed even though the
hashes match. But as you’ll see later, that chance is so small, you
can ignore it.
****

If the new hash matches the one on paper, you can be sure the picture
hasn’t changed. On the other hand, if the hashes don’t match, the cat
picture has definitely changed.

Bitcoin uses cryptographic hash functions a lot to verify that data
hasn’t changed. For example, every now and then—on average, every 10
minutes—a new hash of the entire payment history is created. If someone
tries to change the data, anyone verifying the hash of the modified data
will notice.

==== How does a cryptographic hash function work?

The real answer is complex, so I won’t go into exact detail. But to
help you understand the operation of a cryptographic hash function,
we’ll create a very simplistic one. Well, it isn’t really
cryptographic, as I’ll explain later. Let’s just call it a hash
function for now.

[.gbinfo]
.Modulo
****
_Modulo_ means to wrap around when a calculation reaches a certain
value. For example:

 0   mod 256 = 0
 255 mod 256 = 255
 256 mod 256 = 0
 257 mod 256 = 1
 258 mod 256 = 2

258 mod 256 is the remainder of the integer division 258/256: 258 = 1
× 256 + 2. The remainder is 2.
****

Suppose you want to hash a file containing the six bytes `a1 02 12 6b
c6 7d`. You want the hash to be a 1-byte number (8 bits). You can
construct a hash function using _addition modulo 256_, which means
to wrap around to 0 when the result of an addition reaches 256
(<<fig0210>>).

[[fig0210]]
.Simplistic hash function using byte-wise addition modulo 256
image::{imagedir}/02-10.svg[{big-width}]

The result is the decimal number 99. What does 99 say about the original
input `a1 02 12 6b c6 7d`? Not much—99 looks just as random as any other
single-byte number.

If you change the input, the hash will change, although a chance exists
that the hash will remain 99. After all, this simple hash function has
just 256 different possible outputs. With real cryptographic hash
functions, like the one we used to hash the cat picture, this chance is
unimaginably small. You’ll soon get a glimpse of this probability.

==== Properties of a cryptographic hash function

A cryptographic hash function takes any digital input data, called a
_pre-image_, and produces a fixed-length output, called a _hash_. In
the example with the cat picture on your hard drive, the pre-image is
the cat picture of 1.21 MB, and the hash is a 256-bit number. The
function will output the exact same hash each time the same pre-image is
used. But it will, with extremely high probability, output a totally
different hash when even the slightest variation of that pre-image is
used. The hash is also commonly referred to as a _digest_.

Let’s look at what properties you can expect from a cryptographic hash
function. I’ll illustrate using SHA256 because it’s the one Bitcoin uses
most. Several cryptographic hash functions are available, but they all
provide the same basic properties:

[role="important"]
. The same input will always produce the same hash.
. Slightly different inputs will produce very different hashes.
. The hash is always of the same fixed size. For SHA256, it’s 256 bits.
. Brute-force trial and error is the only known way to find an input
that gives a certain hash.

[[fig0211]]
.A cryptographic hash function, SHA256, in action. The input “Hello!” will give you the same output every time, but the slightly modified input “Hello” will give you totally different output.
image::{imagedir}/02-11.svg[{big-width}]

<<fig0211>> illustrates the first three properties. The fourth property
of a cryptographic hash function is what makes it a _cryptographic_ hash
function, and this needs a bit more elaboration. There are some
variations to the fourth property, all of which are desirable for
cryptographic hash functions (<<fig0212>>):

Collision resistance:: You have only the cryptographic hash function
at hand. It’s hard to find two _different_ inputs that _result in the
same hash_.

Pre-image resistance:: You have the hash function and a hash. It’s
hard to find _a pre-image of that hash_.

Second-pre-image resistance:: You have the hash function and a
pre-image (and thus the hash of that pre-image). It’s hard to find
_another pre-image with the same hash_.

[[fig0212]]
.Different desirable properties for cryptographic hash functions. For collision resistance, X can be anything, as long as the two _different_ inputs give the same output X.
image::{imagedir}/02-12.svg[{big-width}]

==== Illustration of “hard”

The term _hard_ in this context means astronomically hard. It’s silly to
even try. We’ll look at second-pre-image resistance as an example of
what _hard_ means, but a similar example can be made for any of the
three variants.

****
image::{imagedir}/u02-03.svg[]
****


Suppose you want to find an input to SHA256 that results in the same hash
as “Hello!”:

 334d016f755cd6dc58c53a86e183882f8ec14f52fb05345887c8a5edd42c87b7

You can’t change the input “Hello!” just a little so the function “won’t
notice.” It _will_ notice and will output a totally different hash. The
only way to find an input other than “Hello!” that gives the hash
`334d016f...d42c87b7` is to try different inputs one by one and check
whether one produces the desired hash.

Let’s try, using <<tab0203>>.

[[tab0203]]
.Finding an input with the same hash as “Hello!” is nearly impossible.

[.gbinfo]
.How big is 2^256^?
****
2^256^ is about 10^77^, which is almost the number of atoms in the
universe. Finding a pre-image of a SHA256 hash is like picking an atom
in the universe and hoping it’s the correct one.
****

As you can see, we aren’t very successful. Think about how much time
it would take for a typical desktop computer to find such an input. It
can calculate about 60 million hashes per second, and the expected
number of tries needed to find a solution is 2^255^. The result is
2^255^ / (60 × 10^6^) s ≈ 10^68^ s ≈ 3 × 10^61^ years, or about
30,000,000,000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000,&#8203;000
years.

I think we can stop trying, don’t you? I don’t think buying a faster
computer will help, either. Even if we had 1 trillion computers and
ran them concurrently, it would take about 3 × 10^49^ years.

Pre-image resistance, second-pre-image resistance, and collision
resistance are extremely important in Bitcoin. Most of its security
relies on these properties.

==== Some well-known hash functions

We most often use double SHA256 in Bitcoin:

<<tab0204>> shows several different cryptographic hash functions. Some
aren’t considered cryptographically secure.

| MD5 | 128 | No. Collisions can be trivially created. The algorithm is also
vulnerable to pre-image attacks, but not trivially. |No
|===

Generally, when a single collision has been found in a cryptographic
hash function, most cryptographers will consider the function
insecure.

==== Recap of cryptographic hashes


A cryptographic hash function is a computer program that takes any data
as input and computes a big number—a cryptographic hash—based on that
input.

image::{imagedir}/u02-06.svg[{big-width}]

****
image::{imagedir}/u02-05.svg[]
****

It’s astronomically hard to find an input that will result in a specific
output. This is why we call it a _one-way function_. You have to
repeatedly guess different inputs.

We’ll discuss important topics throughout this book. When you’ve learned
about a specific topic, like cryptographic hash functions, you can put a
new tool into your toolbox for later use. Your first tool is the
cryptographic hash function, which is represented here by a paper
shredder; the cryptographic hash is represented by a pile of paper
strips.

image::{imagedir}/u02-08.svg[{half-width}]

From now on, we’ll use these tool icons to represent cryptographic
hash functions and cryptographic hashes, with some exceptions.

=== Digital signatures

****
image::{imagedir}/u02-11.svg[]
****


In this section, we explore how you can prove to someone that you
approve a payment. To do that, we use _digital signatures_. A digital
signature is a digital equivalent of a handwritten signature. The
difference is that a handwritten signature is tied to a person, whereas
a digital signature is tied to a random number called a _private key_.
A digital signature is much harder to forge than a handwritten
signature.

==== Typical use of digital signatures

Suppose you want to send your favorite cat picture to your friend Fred
via email, but you suspect the picture might be, maliciously or
accidentally, corrupted during transfer. How would you and Fred make
sure the picture Fred receives is exactly the same as the one you
send?


[[signing-overview]]
.You send a digitally signed cat picture to Fred. Fred verifies the signature to make sure he’s got the same cat as the cat you signed.
image::{imagedir}/02-13.svg[{full-width}]

You can include a digital signature of the cat picture in the email.
Fred can then verify this digital signature to make sure the cat
picture is authentic. You do this in three different phases, as
<<signing-overview>> shows.


Step 1 is _preparation_. You create a huge random number: the private
key. You can use this to create digital signatures. You then create the
_public key_, which is used to verify the signatures the private key
creates. The public key is _calculated_ from the private key. You hand
the public key to Fred in person so Fred is sure it belongs to you.

Step 2 is _signing_. You write an email to Fred and attach the cat
picture. You also use your private key and the cat picture to digitally
sign the cat picture. The result is a digital signature that you include
in your email message. You then send the email to Fred.

Step 3 is _verifying_. Fred receives your email, but he’s concerned
the cat picture might be corrupt, so he wants to verify the signature.
He uses the public key he got from you in step 3, the digital signature
in the email, and the attached cat picture. If the signature or the cat
picture has changed since you created the signature, the verification
will fail.

[[improving-cookie-token-security]]
==== Improving cookie token security

It’s time to return to our cookie token spreadsheet. The company is
growing, and Lisa has a hard time recognizing everyone. She notices that
some people aren’t honest. For example, Mallory says she is Anne, to
trick Lisa into moving cookie tokens from Anne to the cafe, instead of
from Mallory to the cafe. Lisa thinks of requiring everybody to
digitally sign their cookie token transfers by writing a message and a
digital signature in an email, as <<fig0214>> shows.

[[fig0214]]
.John needs to digitally sign his payment request and include the signature in the email.
image::{imagedir}/02-14.svg[{half-width}]

Suppose John is the new guy at the office. The company gave him some
cookie tokens as a welcome gift when he started. Now, John wants to buy
a cookie in the cafe for 10 CT. He needs to digitally sign a cookie
token transfer. <<generate-key-pair>> shows what he has to do.

[[generate-key-pair]]
.The digital signature process. 1. John creates a key pair and gives the public key to Lisa. 2. John signs a message with the private key. 3. Lisa verifies the message is signed with the private key belonging to the public key she got from John.
image::{imagedir}/02-15.svg[{full-width}]


Just as with the email to Fred in the previous section, there are three
phases in this process (please compare with the steps in <<signing-overview>> to
see the similarities):

[.gbinfo]
.Key pair reuse
****
A key pair is created once. The same private key can be used several
times to digitally sign stuff.
****

. John prepares by generating a key pair. John keeps the private key
secret and hands the public key over to Lisa. This is a one-time setup
step.

. John wants a cookie. He writes a message and signs it with his
private key. He sends the message and the digital signature in an
email to Lisa.

. Lisa verifies the signature of the message using John’s public key
and updates the spreadsheet.

==== Preparation: John generates a key pair

****
image::{imagedir}/u02-12.svg[]
****

The signing and verification processes are based on a key pair. John
needs a private key to sign payments, and Lisa will need John’s public
key to verify John’s signatures. John needs to prepare for this by
creating a key pair. He does this by first generating a private key and
then calculating the public key from that private key, as <<fig0216>>
shows.

[[fig0216]]
.John creates a key pair. The private key is a huge random number, and the public key is derived from that random number. John stores his private key on his hard drive, and the public key is handed to Lisa.
image::{imagedir}/02-16.svg[{full-width}]

John will use a random number generator to generate a huge, 256-bit
random number. A random number generator is available on almost all
operating systems. The random number is now John’s private key. The
private key is then transformed into a public key using a public-key

[role="important"]
Public-key derivation is a one-way function, just like cryptographic
hash functions; you can’t derive the private key from the public key.
The security of digital signatures relies heavily on this feature. Also,
running the private key through the public-key derivation function
multiple times will always result in the same public key.

The public key is 33 bytes (66 hex digits) long. This is longer than
the private key, which is 32 bytes (64 hex digits) long. The reason
for the “extra” byte and how the public-key derivation function works
is a hard topic, covered in <<ch04>>. Luckily, you don’t have to be a
cryptography expert to understand how signatures work from a user’s
perspective.

===== Two ways to use the key pair

Keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data. Encryption is used to make
messages unreadable to everybody but those who hold the proper
decryption key.

We can think of the private and public keys as a pair because they have
a strong relationship: the public key can be used to encrypt messages
that only the private key can decrypt, and the private key can encrypt
messages that can only the public key can decrypt (<<enc-dec-public-private>>).

[.gbinfo]
****
We’ll use the right side of <<enc-dec-public-private>> to make digital
signatures. We won’t use the left side at all in this book.
****

Following the left side of <<enc-dec-public-private>>, only John would
be able to read the encrypted message because he’s the only one with
access to his private key. Bitcoin doesn’t use this feature of public
and private keys at all. It’s used when two parties want to
communicate in private, as when you do your online banking. When you
see the little padlock in the address bar of your web browser, then
you know the process shown on the left side of the figure is being
used to secure your communication.

Following the right side of the figure, Lisa can decrypt the message
because she has the public key belonging to John’s private key. This
feature is used for digital signatures. Using the private key to
encrypt secret messages isn’t a good idea because the public key is,
well, public. Anyone with the public key can decrypt the
message. Digital signatures, on the other hand, don’t need any secret
messages. We’ll explore digital signatures deeper soon. But first,
some recap and orientation.

==== Recap of key pairs

Let’s summarize what you’ve learned about public and private keys. You
create a key pair by first creating a private key. The private key is
a huge, secret random number. The public key is then calculated from
the private key.

image::{imagedir}/u02-14.svg[{big-width}]

You can use the private key to encrypt a message that can be decrypted
only using the public key.

image::{imagedir}/u02-15.svg[{half-width}]

The encryption and decryption in this figure are the foundation for
digital signatures. This process is _not_ suitable for sending secret
messages because the public key is usually widely known.

The reverse process is also common, in which the public key is used to
encrypt and the private key is used to decrypt. This process is used
to send secret messages. Bitcoin doesn’t use it.

==== Where were we?


Digital signatures were briefly mentioned in <<ch01>>, where Alice
signed her Bitcoin transaction of 1 BTC to Bob using her private key
(<<fig0218>>).

[[fig0218]]
.Digital signatures in Bitcoin
image::{imagedir}/02-18.svg[{half-width}]

John has created a pair of keys and is about to digitally sign his
payment to the cafe with his private key so Lisa can verify that it’s
actually John making the payment. Lisa verifies this using John’s
public
key.

==== John signs his payment

****
image::{imagedir}/u02-17.svg[]
****

Let’s have a close look at how the signing really happens (<<fig0219>>).

The message John wants to sign is, “Lisa, please move 10CT to Cafe.
/John”. The signing function will hash this message with SHA256, whose
output is a 256-bit number. This hash value is then encrypted with
John’s private key. The result is a digital signature that looks like
this:

 INxAs7oFDr80ywy4bt5uYPIv/09fJMW+04U3sJUfgV39
 A2k8BKzoFRHBXm8AJeQwnroNb7qagg9QMj7Vp2wcl+c=


[[fig0219]]
.John digitally signs the transfer of 10 CT to the cafe. The message to Lisa is first hashed and then encrypted with John’s private key. The email to Lisa contains both the message in cleartext and the signature.
image::{imagedir}/02-19.svg[{big-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Signatures in Bitcoin
****
Bitcoin uses this type of signature for most payments today, but it
isn’t the only way to authenticate a payment.
****

[role="important"]

The signature is an encrypted hash of a message. If John had used
another private key to sign with or a slightly different message, the
signature would have looked completely different.

For example, using the input message “Lisa, please move 10CT to
Mallory.  /John” would generate this signature:

 ILDtL+AVMmOrcrvCRwnsJUJUtzedNkSoLb7OLRoH2iaD
 G1f2WX1dAOTYkszR1z0TfTVIVwdAlD0W7B2hBTAzFkk=

This isn’t remotely similar to the previous signature. This is good
for John, because he knows his signature can’t be used for messages
other than his specific message.

John has now composed an email to Lisa. This email contains a message
and a signature of that message. John finishes by sending the email to
Lisa.

==== Lisa verifies the signature

****
image::{imagedir}/u02-18.svg[]
****

Lisa looks at the email and sees it claims to be from John, so she
looks up John in her table of public keys (<<fig0220>>).

[[fig0220]]
.Lisa uses the message (A), the signature (B), and John’s public key \(C) to verify that the message is signed with John’s private key.
image::{imagedir}/02-20.svg[{big-width}]

Lisa’s actions in this figure aim to determine that the cookie token
transfer was signed by the private key it claims to be signed with. The
message _says_ it’s from John. She received John’s public key the other
day and put that public key in her table of public keys. The things she
has at hand are

A. The message “Lisa, please move 10CT to Cafe. /John”
B. The signature `INxAs7oFDr8…`
C. John’s public key that she just looked up in her table


.A signature is an encrypted hash
****
image::{imagedir}/u02-19.svg[]
****

[role="important"]

John encrypted the message’s hash with his _private_ key. This
encrypted hash is the signature. If Lisa decrypts the signature (B) with
John’s _public_ key \(C), the result should be a hash that equals the
hash of the message (A) in the email.

Lisa takes the signature (B) and decrypts it with the public key \(C)
she looked up in her table of public keys. The decryption outputs a
big number. If this number is equal to the hash of the message (A), it
proves John’s private key was used to sign the message. Lisa takes the
message (A), exactly as written, and hashes that message just like John
did when he created the signature. This message hash is then compared
with the decrypted signature. The message hash and the decrypted
signature match, which means the signature is valid.

Note that this process works only if John and Lisa use the exact same
digital signature scheme. This must be agreed on beforehand, but it’s
usually standardized. In Bitcoin, everyone knows exactly what digital
signature scheme to use.

Lisa can now be sure no one is trying to fool her. She updates the
spreadsheet with John’s transfer, as shown in <<fig0221>>.

[[fig0221]]
.Lisa has added a row for John’s cookie token transfer after verifying the signature of John’s message.
image::{imagedir}/02-21.svg[{big-width}]

==== Private key security

John is in control of his cookie tokens because he owns the private key.
No one but John can use John’s cookie tokens because he’s the only one
with access to his private key. If his private key is stolen, he can
lose any and all of his cookie tokens.

The morning after John’s transfer, he comes to the office, takes his
laptop from his desk, and goes straight to the cafe to buy two morning
cookies. He opens his laptop to write an email to Lisa:

 Good morning Lisa! Please move 20 CT to Cafe. /John
 Signature:
 H1CdE34cRuJDsHo5VnpvKqllC5JrMJ1jWcUjL2VjPbsj
 X6pi/up07q/gWxStb1biGU2fjcKpT4DIxlNd2da9x0o=

He sends this email containing the message and a signature to Lisa. But
the cafe doesn’t hand him any cookies. The guy behind the desk says he
hasn’t seen an incoming payment of 20 CT yet. Lisa usually verifies and
executes transfers quickly.

John opens the spreadsheet—he has read-only access, remember—and
searches for “John.” <<fig0222>> shows what he sees.

[[fig0222]]
.Someone stole money from John. Who is Melissa, and how was this possible? John didn’t sign any such transfer.
image::{imagedir}/02-22.svg[{big-width}]

John steps into Lisa’s office, asking for an explanation. She answers
that she got a message signed with John’s private key, asking her to
send money to a new coworker, Melissa. Lisa even shows him the message
and signature. Of course, there is no Melissa at the office, even though
several new employees have started at the company. Lisa doesn’t care
about names anymore, only public keys and signatures. But she needs the
name to look up the correct public key in the table.

The explanation to all this is that Mallory has

. Managed to copy John’s private key. John’s laptop has been on his desk
all night long. Anyone could have taken the hard drive out of the laptop
to search for his private key.

. Created a new key pair and sent the new public key to Lisa, with the
following message:

 Hi Lisa. My name is Melissa, and I’m new here.
 My public key is
 02c5d2dd24ad71f89bfd99b9c2132f796fa746596a06f5a33c53c9d762e37d9008

. Sent a fraudulent message, signed with the stolen private key, to Lisa
as follows:

 Hi Lisa, please move 90 CT to Melissa. Thanks, John
 Signature:
 IPSq8z0IyCVZNZNMIgrOz5CNRRtRO+A8Tc3j9og4pWbA
 H/zT22dQEhSaFSwOXNp0lOyE34d1+4e30R86qzEbJIw=


//######YOU ARE HERE#######

Lisa verified the transfer in step 3, concluded it was valid, and
executed the transfer. John asks Lisa to revert the—according to
him—fraudulent transfer. But Lisa refuses to do so. She thinks the
transfer is perfectly valid. If John let someone see his private key,
that’s his problem, not Lisa’s. That’s part of why she’s so trusted in
the company—she keeps her promises.

John creates a new key pair and asks Lisa to add his new public key
under the name John2. How can John secure his new private key and still
have it readily available when he wants a cookie? John is pretty sure he
won’t have more than 1,000 cookie tokens on that key.

[.gbinfo]
.You are responsible
****
You have full responsibility for the security of your private keys.
****

The security of the spreadsheet has shifted from a system in which Lisa
knows everyone’s face to one in which she knows everyone’s public key.
In a sense, the security could be worse now, because it might be easier
for Mallory to steal John’s private key than it is for her to trick Lisa
into thinking Mallory is John. This depends on how John protects his
private key. An important thing to note is that the security of John’s
private key is totally up to him. No one will be able to restore John’s
private key if he loses it. And Lisa sure isn’t going to reverse
“fraudulent” transfers just because John is sloppy with security.

If John stores his private key in cleartext in a shared folder on the
company’s intranet, anyone can easily copy it and use it to steal his
cookie tokens. But if John stores the private key in an encrypted file,
protected by a strong password, on his own laptop’s hard drive, getting
a copy of his key is a lot harder. An attacker would have to

. Get access to John’s hard drive
. Know John’s password

If John never has more than 50 CT on his private key, he might not be
that concerned with security. But the cafe, which manages about 10,000
CT daily, might be concerned. John and the cafe probably need different
strategies for storing their private keys.

A trade-off exists between security and convenience. You can, for
example, keep your private key encrypted on an offline laptop in a bank
safe-deposit box. When you want to buy a cookie, you’ll need to go to
the bank, take the laptop out of your safe-deposit box, decrypt the
private key with your password, and use it to digitally sign a message
to Lisa that you save to a USB stick. Then, you’ll have to put the
laptop back into the safe-deposit box, bring the USB stick back to the
office, and send the email to Lisa. The private key never leaves +
the laptop in the safe-deposit box. Very secure, and very inconvenient.

On the other hand, you can store your private key in cleartext on your
mobile phone. You’ll have the key at your fingertips and can sign a
message within seconds of when the urge for a cookie starts to nudge
you. Very insecure, and very convenient.

[[fig0223]]
.Security considerations against attackers. Note how the more secure options are also more inconvenient.
image::{imagedir}/02-23.svg[{half-width}]

Some of the different trade-offs, as illustrated in <<fig0223>>, are
as follows:

Online vs. offline:: Online means the private key is stored on a
device with network access, like your mobile phone or general-purpose
laptop. Offline means the private key is stored on a piece of paper or
a computer without any network access. Online storage is risky because
remote security exploits or malicious software on your computer, such
as computer viruses, might send the private key to someone without you
noticing. If the device is offline, no one can take the private key
without physical access to the device.

Cleartext vs. encrypted:: If the private key is stored in cleartext in
a file on your computer’s hard drive, anyone with access to your
computer, either remotely over a computer network or physically, can
copy the private key. This includes any viruses your computer might be
victim to. You can avoid many of these attacks by encrypting your
private key with a password that only you know. An attacker would then
need access to both your hard drive and your secret password to get
the private key.

Whole key vs. split key:: People usually store their entire private
key on a single computer. This is convenient—you need only one
computer to spend your cookie tokens. An attacker must get access to
your hard drive to steal the private key. But if your private key is
split into three parts (there are good and bad schemes for this—be
careful), and you store the three parts separately on three different
computers, then the attacker must get access to the hard drives of
three computers. This is much harder because they must know what three
computers to attack and also successfully attack them. Making a
payment in this setup is a real hassle, but very secure.

You can use any combination of these methods to store your keys. But
as a rule of thumb, the greater the security against attackers, the
greater the risk of you accidentally losing access to your key. For
example, if you store the private key encrypted on your hard drive,
you risk losing your key due to both computer failure and forgetting
your password. In this sense, the more securely you store your key,
the less secure it is.

=== Recap

Lisa has solved the problem with people claiming to be someone else when
they make a payment. She requires all payers to digitally sign the
cookie token transfers. Every spreadsheet user needs a private key and a
public key. Lisa keeps track of who owns which public key. From now on,
a payment must be written in an email to Lisa, and the message must be
digitally signed with the person’s private key. Lisa can then verify the
signature to make sure she isn’t being fooled. The gist is that as long
as John keeps his private key to himself, no one will be able to spend
his money.

=== Exercises

==== Warm up

[start=8]
. Lisa is currently rewarded 7,200 CT per day for her work. Why won’t
the supply increase infinitely over time? Why don’t we have 7,200 ×
10,000 = 72 million CT after 10,000 days?

. How can coworkers detect if Lisa rewards herself too much or too
often?

. How is the private key of a key pair created?

. What key is used to digitally sign a message?

. The signing process hashes the message to sign. Why?

. What would Mallory need to steal cookie tokens from John?

==== Dig in

[start=14]
. Suppose you have a private key and you’ve given your public key to a
friend, Fred. Suggest how Fred can send you a secret message that only
you can understand.

. Suppose you (let’s pretend your name is Laura) and Fred still have
the keys from the previous exercise. Now you want to send a message in
a bottle to Fred saying,
+
----
Hi Fred! Can we meet at Tiffany’s at sunset tomorrow? /Laura
----
+
Explain how you would sign the message so Fred can be sure the message
is actually from you. Explain what steps you and Fred take in the
process.

=== Summary

* Bitcoins are created as rewards to nodes securing the blockchain.

* The reward halves every four years to limit the money supply.

* You can use cryptographic hash functions to detect changes in a file
or in a message.

* You can’t make up a pre-image of a cryptographic hash. A pre-image
is an input that has a certain known output.

* Digital signatures are useful to prove a payment’s
authenticity. Only the rightful owner of bitcoins may spend them.

* Someone verifying a digital signature doesn’t have to know _who_
made the signature. They just have to know the signature was made with
the private key the signature claims to be signed with.

* To receive bitcoins or cookie tokens, you need a public key. First,
you create a private key for yourself in private. You then derive your
public key from your private key.

* Several strategies are available for storing private keys, ranging
from unencrypted on your mobile phone to split and encrypted across
several offline devices.

* As a general rule of thumb, the more secure the private key is
against theft, the easier it is to accidentally lose the key, and vice
versa.
