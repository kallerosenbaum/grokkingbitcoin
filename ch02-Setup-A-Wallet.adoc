== Setup a wallet
:imagedir: {baseimagedir}/ch02

This chapter covers

* installing a Bitcoin wallet
* understainding Bitcoin addresses
* securing your wallet

Now that the introduction is out of the way, let us get more
hands-on. We will walk you through the installation of a Bitcoin
wallet and explain some fundamental concepts that are important for
wallets. Not only for wallets but for the whole Bitcoin system. 

The main objective of this chapter is to teach you how the wallet
manages your private keys and how addresses are generated from those
private keys.

=== What is a wallet?

In section <<overview-wallets>> we noted that a wallet stores its
user's private keys. Now we will look deeper into how that is done. At
it's very core, a Bitcoin wallet is a container for private keys. The
private keys are what Bitcoin users need in order to spend their
money. Anyone that can get their hands on the private keys will be
able to spend the money. A wallet will help the user keep the private
keys safe from prying eyes as well as protect them from loss.

=== Install a wallet

To help you get a feel for what a wallet is, we will start by getting
a wallet installed on your device. There are a few steps involved in
installing a wallet:

. Select your wallet application
. Install the wallet application
. Start the wallet
. Backup your wallet
. Secure the private keys

==== Select a wallet

There are several different wallet applications for a lot of
platforms, like Android phones, iPads, Linux computers and Windows
computers. The following table lists a good option for each major
mobile platform:

.Bitcoin wallet software for different platforms
|===
| Wallet name | Platforms

| Copay | Most platforms, including Windows Phone

| Mycelium | Android, iOS

| breadwallet | Android, iOS

//Should probably add specific app for desktops, to show that there
// are such options.
|===

While all these options are good for beginners, there are several
others on each platform. If you want to delve further into the
plethora of options, please visit http://bitcoin.org to find a wallet
that suits you.

I will use Copay througout this book. You are free to try any of the
wallet application, but they might differ a bit from Copay, which can
make it harder to follow the steps in this book. I chose Copay
primarily because it is available on all major platforms, so that you
can easily follow the examples no matter what platform you use. To
make it as easy as possible for you, I recommend that you use Copay as
well.

The instructions in this book will only use Copay. If you chose to use
another wallet, you may have to adjust my steps. The main steps are
usually the same on different wallets, but they may differ in how they
look and what security features they have. If you try one of the other
wallets and later change your mind, don't worry. You can install Copay
later and move your money to the Copay wallet instead.

==== Install your wallet

If you are on any of the popular mobile platforms, you should be able
to install the app right from where apps are installed on your
platform. Search for "copay" and make sure that the vendor is "BitPay,
Inc". If you are on a desktop computer, please go to https://copay.io/
to download a wallet for your operating system.

==== Start your wallet

Once you have installed your wallet, either on your mobile device or
on a desktop computer, you are ready to start the application. On your
mobile device, start by hitting the icon for Copay. If you use a
desktop computer, follow the intructions on the web site.

When the wallet starts you will be presented with the "Terms of
Use". Read them if you want and then click on "I AGREE, GET
STARTED". Shortly after, you will be presented with a screen showing
the balance of your newly created wallet:

.Start screen of your wallet.

There's not much to see here. You have 0 _bits_. This brings us to the
world of Bitcoin units. 1 bitcoin is worth around 1000 USD, which
makes it an impractical unit for smaller amounts, for example 1 USD
equals about 0.001 bitcoin. Different units have emerged throughout
the Bitcoin community over time to overcome this issue:

// TODO insert symbols
|===
| Unit | Symbol | In bitcion | Comment
| 1 bitcoin |   | 1 | This is the first unit used.
| 1 bitcent | | 0.01 | Rarely used, but should make sense to people used
  to dollars and cents.
| 1 millibit | | 0.001 | Commonly used by wallet applications
| 1 bit, 1 microbit | | 0.000001 | Default unit of Copay
| 1 satoshi | | 0.00000001 | The smallest fraction possible today,
  named after the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.
|===

The default unit of Copay is bits, which is 0.00001 bitcoin. If you
prefer bitcion instead, you can change the unit in Copay under
Menu->SETTINGS->Unit and select BTC.

I would like to congratulate you for your new wallet now, but there's
one more very important thing left to do before opening the
chamagne. Backup.

=== Backup your wallet

Before doing anything at all with your wallet, you should do a proper
backup. In fact, Copay will not let you do anything before making a
backup. A wallet is just another software application on your phone or
computer, and the application's data may get stolen, lost or corrupted
at any time. There is no third party in Bitcoin, like with Google or a
Bank, that you can go to to recover lost funds. If you lose your
wallet data, you lose your bitcoins. Forever. Think of your bitcoins
as cash in a physical wallet.

Luckily, backing up a Bitcoin wallet is usually a smooth process. You
need

* your wallet application
* a pen
* a paper

Now is the time for you to grab the above needed items. When you are
back, please continue reading.

Start your wallet application and click on the litte gear in the upper
right corner.

.Backup options is found here.
image::{imagedir}/settings.png[{half-width}]

Click on "Backup". Your wallet will display twelve english
words. Use your pen to write those twelve words down on your paper. Do
not take a screenshot. Screenshots are saved on your phone or even on
on-line storage like Google Drive or Apple's iCloud.

.Your 12 words phrase.
image::{imagedir}/backup.png[{half-width}]

.Backup your 12 words phrase.
image::{imagedir}/writing_mnemonic.jpg[{half-width}]

The words you have written on your paper is your backup. You can
recover all your funds at any time in the future using that
paper. Anyone else who gets access to the paper will also be able to
do it. Just like the wallet, the backup should be thought of as cash.

You have now created your backup. It's time to verify that your backup
is OK. Click "CONTINUE" in your wallet application. Your twelve words
are displayed in alphabetic order. Click on them in the order you
wrote them down and click "CONTINUE".

.Verify your 12 words backup phrase.
image::{imagedir}/verify_backup.png[{half-width}]

You will be congratulated by the
application. Click "FINISH".

Now, take the paper and store it in a safe place. When the paper is
stored safely, it is time for me to congratulate you to your newly
installed and backed up wallet!

.Contratulations!

=== Generate a Bitcoin address

The next step after setting up and backup up your wallet is to create
a Bitcoin address.

You are probably already familiar with email addresses. You can think
of Bitcoin addresses in the same way as email addresses. If you want
to send an email to your friend, you need your friend's email
address. If you want to send bitcoins to your friend, you need your
friend's Bitcoin address.

We will let your wallet create an address for you and in the next
section we will explore what the wallet software actually did to
generate the address. Your wallet will automatically create addresses
for you when you need them. In fact, your first address is already
generated, you just haven't seen it yet. Click on "Receive" in the
lower left corner of your screen in the Copay app.

.Get an address in your wallet app by clicking on the "Receive" tab.
image::{imagedir}/generate_address.png[{quart-width}]

.Your first Bitcoin address
image::{imagedir}/new_address.png[{quart-width}]

What you see on this screen is your Bitcoin address. It is displayed
in two ways: As plain text and as a QR code. A QR code is a way to
display text so that machines can easily scan it. Most mobile wallets
are able to scan QR codes of Bitcoin addresses to make payments.

The Bitcoin address in this example is

    1BZRcHHYE56JcX1wvGvoFuAA638Ye3zcUQ

Your Bitcoin address from your wallet will look different from the
above and the length of the address may differ slightly. An address
like this is what Bob needs to send to Alice in order to receive money
from her.

=== Bitcoin addresses

This section will go deep on what a Bitcoin address is and how it is
created. The Bitcoin address creation process is complex and some new
pretty hard topics will be introduced, but we will take it slow. I
recommend you to carefully read and understand this section, because
the topics you will learn here is vital for the rest of this book. If
you do not get it, please try again. If you still have a hard time
understanding, you should go to the movies and revisit this section
tomorrow.

Bob want’s to receive bitcoins from Alice in our example from chapter
1, so he needs to create a Bitcoin address to give to Alice.

==== Address creation process

The Bitcoin address creation process involves a number of technical topics:

Public-key cryptography:: A key-pair of public and private keys is
created which is used later when signing and validating
transactions. The public and private keys are blablabla.

Cryptographic hash function:: This is a family of algorithms that
takes any data as input and outptus a fixed length huge number. You
cannot from the output number figure out what the input data was.

Base58 encoding:: This is a way to translate a series of bytes, into a
series of letters and digits, which appropriate for printing and
reading.

These topics will be covered after the overview section.

===== Overview

Let us start with a big diagrom of the whole process and then break it
down.

.Bitcoin address creation process. The process goes through three phases: 1) Create a private-public key pair, 2) Hash the public key, and 3) Encode the public key hash into a manageable and error resistant format. The encoding part is reversable, you can move from the Bitcoin address after step 3 to the hash value at step 2.
image::{imagedir}/mental_model_address_creation.png[{full-width}]

This diagram shows that the process is divided in three major
part.

The first part, Public-key cryptography is used to generate a key-pair
of a private and a public key. Public-key cryptography in Bitcoin is
used for signing and verifying Bitcoin transactions. The private key
is used to digitally sign a transaction and the public key is used to
validate the signature. You can easily derive the public key from the
private key through the Public key derivation function, but you cannot
derive the private key from the public key.

The second part, cryptographic hashing, is a way to get a fixed length
"fingerprint" of the public key. The hashing is done in two steps, but
both steps do the same thing, transform the input into a fixed length
number. The first transforms into a 256 bit number and the second into
a 160 bit number. As with public and private keys, the input of a
cyptographic hash algorithm cannot be derived from the output.

In the third part we add some data to the hashing output and encoded
it with Base58. We set add a version number, 0, of the address format
and a checksum. The checksum is used to prevent sending money to a
non-existing Bitcoin address due to bad spelling or transfer issues
when sending the address. The versioned and checksummed hash is
encoded with Base58.

Let us now dig deeper into theese three steps in order of appearance.

===== Create a keypair

:cap: Step 1 of the Bitcoin address creation process. First a huge \
random number, the private key, is created. The private key is then \
transformed by a cryptographic function into a public key.
.{cap}
image::{imagedir}/public_key_cryptography.png[{full-width}]

The outcome of step 1 is a private key and its derived public key. The
public and private keys have a very special relationship. The private
key is used in Bitcoin for making digital signatures. The digital
signature is then verified using the public key.

Let us say that it's Wednesday afternoon and Bob wants to send the
message

 Alice, I love you. /Bob

to Alice. But he fears that someone else might also send messages to
Alice in Bob's name. Not nice. How can Bob send the message so that
Alice can be sure that the message is actually from Bob?

Alice and Bob knows about public-key cryptography. This morning, Alice
and Bob met up at a café for breakfast before Alice went to
work. During breakfast Bob gave Alice his public key. Alice now knows
that this public key belongs to Bob. She also knows that only Bob have
access to the private key.

Now, it's Wednesdey afternoon and Alice is working. Bob decides to
send his message to Alice.

.Bob signs his message with his private key and sends the message, his public key and the signature to Alice who verifies it with the public key she knows belongs to Bob.
image::{imagedir}/sign_message.png[{full-width}]

On the left side Bob is using his private key that only he has
access to. He uses it to digitally sign the message "Alice, I
love you. /Bob". He then writes the message, his public key and his
newly created signature in an email and sends it to Alice.

Alice reads the message, but she is very concerned with security, so
she wants to make sure this message is actually from Bob. So she takes
the public key she knows belongs to Bob, the one she got at breakfast,
and compares it to the public key in the message. They match. Now
using the message, the public key and the signature she can verify
that only Bob could have created this signature.

We will get back and look more closely at digital signatures in
[REFERENCE chapter 4]. For now we can just conclude that Bob's wallet
have created a cryptographic key pair that can be used to sign and
verify stuff. The wallet have stored the private key for
later use. The public key is passed on to the next step in the Bitcoin
address creation proccess.

===== Hash the public key

Step 2 blablabla

.Step 2 of the Bitcoin address creation process. A cryptographic hash is a huge number generated from its input. Different inputs generate different outputs with very high probability. It is extremely hard to find two different inputs with the same outputs.
image::{imagedir}/cryptographic_hashing.png[{full-width}]

===== Encode the Bitcoin address

Step 3 blablabla

.Step 3 of the Bitcoin address creation process. The hash of the public key is decorated with a version number and a checksum. Then the decorated hash is encoded with a Base58 to produce the final Bitcoin address.
image::{imagedir}/address_encoding.png[{full-width}]

==== Public-key cryptography

(Christina and Bert, maybe we should move this section to chapter 4
instead where this tech is actually used. The only thing we do in the
address creation process with regards to public-key cryptography is to
generate a keypair. I think it will fall out more naturally
chapter 4. )

===== Cryptography

===== Public and Private keys

==== Cryptographic hashes

This section is actually very "JIT" because cryptographic hases are heavily uqsed during the Bitcoin address creation process. Examples and diagrams to follow.

But on a second thought, it would be more JIT in section <<hash-the-public-key>>

=== Protect your keys!

==== Why do I need a backup?

==== Encrypting your backup

A typical wallet is a software program that stores private keys for
its user as well as creating, sending and receiving transactions.



A wallet is where users of the Bitcoin system store their private
keys. In section <<overview-transactions>>, Alice used a key to open
her mailbox to pull out a bill. That key is Alice's private key.
